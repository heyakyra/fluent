# Fluent Syntax Guide

Fluent is a localization paradigm designed to unleash the expressive power
of the natural language. The format used to describe translation resources
used by Fluent is called `FTL`.

FTL is designed to be simple to read, but at the same time allows to represent
complex concepts from natural languages like gender, plurals, conjugations,
and others.

The following chapters will demonstrate how to use FTL to solve localization
challenges. Each chapter contains a hands-on example of simple FTL concepts.
